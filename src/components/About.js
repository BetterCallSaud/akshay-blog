          <br />
          <p>
            Almost 4 years back, I started reading few blogs about investing,
            business and life. Which was a very different experience for me.
            There was a personal wish of mine, back then of start writing
            something. I in an excitement bought a domain name and tried
            designing the blog my self. There came a point when I realised what
            will I write aboutðŸ˜…, who will read it and why will they read it.
            Then the motivation suddenly faded away in a matter of minutes and
            reality hit me hard ðŸ˜…. So I closed everything and said to myself
            not today but will surely start a blog in the future.
          </p><br/>
          <p>
            So, here I am starting it today with a why, little bit of
            excitement, and willingness to share insights on the 5 aspects of
            life. ( Personal, Financial, Mental, Spiritual & Physical ).
          </p>

          <h1 className="text-4xl text-black">Why?</h1>
          <br />
          <p>
            To explore and learn story telling, writing and connecting with like
            minded people and figuring things out on the five aspects mentioned
            above.
